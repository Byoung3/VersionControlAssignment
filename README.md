What is Version Control and why is it used?
  Version control is a way to save and organize changes made to a set of files. It is used to keep work from being lost as well as allowing multiple people from multiple computers to work on the same project.
What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
  Git is the localized command-line piece of software that is the version control system. It tracks the changes to your files and allows you to push your changes to GitHub (or a similar cloud based program) for centralized hosting of your files. 
  Git manages the version history while GitHub is the platform that hosts the git repositories.
Describe what each of the following commands do in your own words:
  Git Clone
    Git clone downloads a copy of the full repository (including version history) onto your local computer.
  Git Status
    Git status gives information about the repository you are currently in, like if there is a file that has been modified.
  Git Add
    Git add with a file directory tells git which files to prepare for a commit.
  Git Commit -m ""
    Git commit saves changes to your locaL repository while giving you the chance to comment on what was changed.
  Git Push
    Git push allows you to upload your commited changes to GitHub (or a similar program) for saving your changes to the cloud.
